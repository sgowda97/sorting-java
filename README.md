Different kinds of sorting programs in Java 

# HOW-TO:

- Assuming you want to use bubble sort, while in the directory in CLI, type:
    - javac BubbleSort.java
    - java BubbleSort
- Follow the instructions.

# Bubble Sort

- Known as the simplest sorting program
- Array is traversed from first element to last element
- Current element is compared with next element, if the current element is greater than next element, it is swapped

# Selection Sort

- Divides the array into two
	- Sorted array
	- Unsorted array
- Checks the entire array for the minimum element and places it at the beginning of the sorted list and so on

# Insertion Sort

- Only good for smaller arrays, because it takes lots of time
- Transfers one element at a time to the right position
